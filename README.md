Singapore Postal Codes
======================

This is an improved version from https://github.com/xkjyeah/singapore-postal-codes
It also contains a dump of all Singapore postal codes retrieved from Onemap.sg.
The download script and the data dump are attached. The original downloaded data is in singpostcode.json.gz, after processing/normalization, it is stored in database.json.gz

It also contains the function code (in dbsearch.py) for address search in database.

Note: Use of the data is governed by the [Open Data Licence](https://www.onemap.sg/legal/opendatalicence.html)

- This data dump contains information from Onemap.sg postal code search accessed on 10 Jun 2020, or later if the date is specified in the commit message.
- This data dump contains information from MyTransport.sg static data, accessed 1 Dec 2017.
- For postal codes, the 2017 database contains 141726 entries, and the 2020 database contains 141848 entries. Interestingly, the 2020 database is about 25% smaller because it keeps fewer floating point digits.
