- This data dump contains information from Onemap.sg postal code search accessed on 10 Jun 2020, or later if the date is specified in the commit message.
- This data dump contains information from MyTransport.sg static data, accessed 1 Dec 2017.
- For postal codes, the 2017 database contains 141726 entries, and the 2020 database contains 141848 entries. Interestingly, the 2020 database is about 25% smaller because it keeps fewer floating point digits.
